I have tried using various blogging platforms such as Wordpress, Hexo, and Notionnext but they did not meet my requirements. However, I recently discovered Astro which is fast and lightweight and satisfies my needs.

I believe that content is more important than formality so I will start writing posts on this site from today without spending too much time on formalities.
